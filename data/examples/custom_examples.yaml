# ─── REPURCHASE EXAMPLES ───
repurchase:
  - source_text: |
      The Fund has adopted, pursuant to Rule 23c-3 under the 1940 Act, a fundamental
      policy, which cannot be changed without shareholder approval, requiring the Fund
      to offer to repurchase at least 5% and up to 25% of its Common Shares at NAV on
      a quarterly basis. Although the policy permits repurchases of between 5% and 25%
      of the Fund's outstanding Common Shares, for each quarterly repurchase offer,
      the Fund currently expects to offer to repurchase 5% of the Fund's outstanding
      Common Shares (in the aggregate across all share classes) at NAV (either by
      number of shares or aggregate NAV) subject to the approval of the Board of
      Trustees. Written notification of each quarterly repurchase offer will be sent
      to shareholders at least 21 calendar days before the repurchase request deadline.

      or interest payments and generate returns primarily from income, in each case,
